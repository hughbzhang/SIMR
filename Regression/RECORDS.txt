Observations:

No bloodflow in central necrosis.
High bloodflow in the surrounding area.
Also need to make sure to DFS for brain area simply because my Convex Hull and Dilation are sometimes outside the brain area.

RANDOM FOREST DECISION TREES ARE AMAZING.

Age is a very strong predictor. Karnofsky score not too bad either.

Current features used: Riesz features, first order statistics in tumor, demographics, contrast.

Added dilation and convex hull features but not too useful.

Combining features helps but I feel as if it is hacking.

Survival model only predicts relative survival. It does NOT say that a patient will survive X months. It only says that patients will die in the following order.

Current accuracy: 75%

Regression states how long until the patient actually dies. Obviously much tougher than survival model.

Current standard error: 8 months.

OOB error rate is indeed lower than actual Cross Validation error. I implemented a binary classifier where you were blocked into groups of high or low survival with the cutoff being at 17 months. OOB error is 15% but CV error is 20%. Still not bad.



It seems that Random Forest tends to overfit by a LOT. SVM is probably a better idea. Age is not nearly as good on SVM (about 30%). I think I can hit 10% error eventually. Screwed up and forgot to normalize.





15% on SVM seems to be the best so far.
Cutting useless features seems to be the logical next step.


Through testing:

C = 1.28
SIGMA = 0.066 
TRAIN = 0.02865385
TEST = 0.1476923
CV = 0.1130769


Using average C and SIGMA values, I get a test accuracy of 13.4%. Not too shabby.


10 Fold CV gives me 11.4% error on 100 random orderings 10Folded
