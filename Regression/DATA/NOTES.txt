Information in the DATA folder seems to have decent correlation with survival


regression.mat contains a bunch of variables that are somewhat useful for doing regression.

DATA DESCRIPTION


Age is in years
Code is the Patient ID used to identify him or her
Death is the number of days until death (0 is unknown 10000 if still alive when data was collected)
Gender is 0 for female 1 for male
Race is 0 White 1 Black 2 Asian
Karn is Karnofsky score (ranges from 0 to 100 and is an indication of the outward physical well being of the patient).



ALLDATA MATRIX

Each row is a patient identified in the ImageID matrix
I replace each missing value by the average in the group.

ALLDATA ROWS

EXPANDED DATA MATRIX

This is my regression data. VERY IMPORTANT.


Row 1: Death

Row 2-4: Age,Karn,Gender (Demographics)

Row 5:13: Riesz Features

Row 14:21 Image first order statistics (mean, median) CALCULATED IN extractFeatures.m


######################################################################

All features are documented in the allFeatures.m MATLAB file.

clinical.txt contains the important clinical features for all patients.
