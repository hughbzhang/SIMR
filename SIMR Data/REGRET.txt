Seems that the best features of contrast and Riesz on CEL do pretty well solo.

USING LEAVE ONE OUT


(17-18)/30 using all imaging features (standard -3 to 3 2^X box)
(20-21) using only 7,8,23

Clinical features only about (16-17) (standard -5 to 5 2^X box)
BUT WHEN ONLY USING 6 7 8 10, can get 87%
